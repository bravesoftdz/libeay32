LibEAY
======

This project aims to be a continuation to Marco Ferrante's libeay32.pas
All credits to him and the original contributers shall remain, as well 
to the Universit√† di Genova.
The original licence terms are also to be taken into account.

I started this project because I use this lib, but in some projects 
it was missing some features I required, so I needed to use additional 
code, code I grouped in a unit which I called originally libeay.ext.
However, the more I used this duo, the more I realized it made no 
sense having it all scatered.
So this happens to group the code in one single unit, that will have 
the same name, with the added code.
This way it becomes easier to use as a git submodule, or even as 
standalone unit file.


Disclaimer
==========

I do not claim credit for any code in this project. 
The original code belongs to the original authors of libeay32.pas 
and the added code was found all over the internet, and merely 
added by me to the unit for convenience. I do not know, unfortunately,
to whom this code's credit is due. If you think it might be you, please
feel free to let me know so I can act accordingly.
